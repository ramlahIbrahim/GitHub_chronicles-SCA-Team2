## 👧🏽 A Bit About Me

Growing up, I was a curious child — always exploring creative things.  
Design, colours… I’d dip into different art spaces just to find what felt like *me*.

That curiosity eventually led me into **tech**. Not the hardcore, technical side — but the soft, sweet, creative part. (Maybe with a touch of chaos too 😅)

To be honest, I haven’t always stayed close to this side of myself. I drifted for a while. But now I’m slowly coming back to it, trying to find where I truly fit in.

## 🎓 Where I Am Now

I’m currently studying **Computer Science**, and while that’s exciting, I’m still figuring out what I want to do with it.  
That uncertainty is part of why I joined the **SCA Open Source Club** — and it’s been such a wholesome space.  
It’s motivating, a little challenging, and it’s helping me connect with fellow beginners like me.

## ✨ What You’ll Find Here

This blog space is where I’ll share:
- What I’m learning  
- Projects I’m trying  
- Challenges, doubts, and tiny wins  

Maybe something here will resonate with another beginner out there. Maybe it’ll make someone feel seen. That alone would make it worth it 🫶🏽
