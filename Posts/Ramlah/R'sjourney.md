🌱 hi, i’m Ramlah — and welcome to my little corner of the team blog!!

as a kid, i was a little bit curious — quietly drawn to how things looked and worked. i found myself playing around with different kinds of art and design, seeing what felt nice to create. over time, that gentle curiosity slowly pulled me into the world of tech.

i’ve always been more into the softer, creative side — things like design, experimenting with styles, and turning small ideas into something real.
i’m not really into the big, technical side of tech — the heavy logic and hardcore part isn’t quite my thing.

but honestly? i didn’t always stick with it. i’d go through phases, try a bit here and there, then paused for a while. now, i’m just finding my way back to it — slowly.


I'm currently  studying computer science — even though i’m still figuring out exactly what i want to do with it. i joined the SCA open source club to explore more, and it’s been motivating! it’s helping me build small projects like this one, learn how github works, and grow alongside other beginners.

this blog is just a little space for me to share the journey — the projects, the progress, the lessons, and the little wins that come from simply showing up and trying.
plus, i hope it helps other beginners feel seen too 😊🤍
