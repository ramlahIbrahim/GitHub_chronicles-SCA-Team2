# My Experience with GitHub

**Wow! You made it here!**

SCA wasn't the first place I heard about GitHub. I was actually checking out someone on social media — a developer — and I happened to see a link to his GitHub page. I don't know if you’ve ever felt this way, but the page looked like puzzle blocks or a Tetris game. I didn’t understand anything! I just knew it was something "dev people" use and that they contribute to projects there.  

I even remember watching a video about it on YouTube, but I didn’t understand it — I can’t remember a thing from it.

But getting into **SCA**, I finally got to understand:

- _What GitHub really is_  
- The **difference between Git and GitHub**  
- And how they're used

Now, I can do basic things like build and contribute to simple projects on GitHub — and that makes me proud. ✨

### What do I think about GitHub now?

It *still* feels like I’m solving a puzzle — but in a fun way.  
The challenges trouble me a little too:  
From trying to really get **when and how to use Git**, to understanding what **branches**, **forks**, and **pull requests** are…  

Then there’s learning to make a GitHub page, using **Markdown**, understanding **YAML**, and so on.

But hey — **ChatGPT deserves big accolades**.  
It was my teacher throughout this journey.  
*What a time to be alive.* 🙌

💡 **A tip for you**:  
You only need **Git** when you’ve cloned a repo and are working **locally on your computer**. You don’t need it at all when you're working directly on your GitHub browser.

### Final Words

Learning to use GitHub can be a little tasking.  
And yes — I was stressed at times. 😮‍💨  
But I *really* enjoyed throwing out the obstacles one by one and feeling like a champion each time. 🏆  

I hope **you** do too.  
Don’t be scared — it’s not totally straightforward, but if you **pay attention**, understand what each thing means, and **make the most of GitHub**, you’ll go far. 💪💻
