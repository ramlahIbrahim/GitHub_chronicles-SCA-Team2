# My GitHub Journey
I initially struggled with GitHub when I first started in tech, finding it overwhelming as a newbie. I had trouble grasping the workflow and ended up putting it on the backburner, which meant I lost track of some projects. However, since joining the **SCA open-source team**, I've gained a deeper understanding of GitHub's purpose and importance. I'm now excited to contribute to projects and showcase my skills – it's a great way to put myself out there and grow as a developer.
