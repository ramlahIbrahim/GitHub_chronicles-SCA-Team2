# 🌱 My Tech Journey

Hi! 👋 I'm currently on an exciting journey through the world of tech 🚀 — full of learning, experiences and all its associated difficulties.

## 🧠 How It Started

I never really had a particular affinity for tech or its numerous branches. I initially saw it as something I could study in the university with as little stress as possible but I've recently decided to give it an actual shot and figure out what I like about it :

With zero experience but a strong will, I believe I can learn to create things and continue exploring.

## 💻 First Steps

Here’s how it began:
- ✅ Wrote my first “Hello, World!” in Python 🐍
- ✅ Then got stuck on a neverending 6-hour python programming YouTube course *“Mosh Hamedani's 😩”*
- ✅ Decided I needed a real commitment, hence, I joined the OAU SCA team (little did I know there were more struggles than a small python course 😅)

## 🌟 Current Focus

I'm now learning step by step:
- 🐍 **Python** for problem-solving
- 🧠 **CS fundamentals** from university
- 💻 **Version control** with Git and GitHub

I’m building consistency, one day at a time 🧩.
